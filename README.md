â€‹

## Getting Started

To run this application locally, you will need to either clone this repository or fork it. You can also download the entire repository as a zip package and run locally.

## Features

e-list is an API service that allows users create bucketlists to store items. Bucketlists are initialized with a name. Items are stored under bucketlists, with a name and a done-status indicating whether item has been completed or not.

For full access to the API, a user account is required. After registration, an initial request is made to log in to user account. This request generates a JSON Web Token, which is returned in the response. This token is used to authenticate subsequent requests to the API.

## Versioning
Changes and upgrades are made from time to time in this API. The API is versioned to avoid code breaking. New changes are implemented under a new version. Currently, the Api handles versioning through headers using the ```ACCEPT``` header. Simply add ```application/vnd.bucketlist.v1``` to your accept header to use version 1. To use subsequent versions of the api, just change v1 to v2 or other versions you want.

## Limitations
The API only responds with json, and does not yet have support for xml and other response types.

OAuth not yet implemented.
